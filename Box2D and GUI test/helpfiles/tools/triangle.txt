The triangle is similar to the block, too. When placed correctly it might be very useful to solve levels. It can be rotated, simply select the object (through clicking on it) and push the arrow buttons "<-" & "->" to rotate the object. Pressing the "->" button will lead to a clockwise rotation, and vise versa. To unselect the object just click elsewhere. To move the object click and hold on the object and drag it with your mouse.
